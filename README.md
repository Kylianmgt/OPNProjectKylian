# OPNProjectKylian

Little game that I made while learning Kotlin. 
I used KorGE plugin for the graphical motor, thanks to this plugin, you can run it on a web server (NodeJS) or in a JVM. You can select the support in the Gradle window OPNProjectKylian>Tasks>run

Just press space in the program and you will understand this simple game :)
